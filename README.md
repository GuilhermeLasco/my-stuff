Hello! I'm probably gonna be the only one who's gonna read this but I will write on this anyway because I don't see any reason as to why not, right?
Well I'm currently writing this from VSCode just to try and learn how git and source control in general work, so I guess that's interesting? Maybe.
Now I'm gonna try to write some actual code, see ya! o7
